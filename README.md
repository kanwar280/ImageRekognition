This rest based API basically runs on AWS Lambda and Runs each time somebody interacts with it on my portfolio website.
All images are sent in base-64 from Angular frontend to this service so we filter the base-64 string of unneccessary information, and then image goes into Amazon lambda and it returns labels,
We then send those labels into bedrock LLM, we are using Amazon Titan G1.
